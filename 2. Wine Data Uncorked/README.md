# 🍷 Wine Data Uncorked: A Visual Deep Dive Using Python

Welcome to a flavorful exploration of the classic **Wine dataset** from scikit-learn. This project uses **Python**, **Pandas**, **Matplotlib**, and **NumPy** to analyze and visualize the chemical composition of three wine types. Through vibrant visual storytelling, it showcases key features such as **Alcohol**, **Malic Acid**, **Ash**, and **Flavanoids** across different wine classes.
